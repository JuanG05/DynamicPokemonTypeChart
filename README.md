An app made by a fan, for fans.

The goal is to provide an easier way to get the Resistances and Weaknesses of the Pokémon types.

Get to choose the type chart of whatever generation you are playing.
Updated to Generation 9 (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet). Before DLC(s)

This app is an extract from another unfinished side project of mine.
